ESTIMATION TASK — VERSION CHANGELOG
====================================

v9-neutral-header-subaction-tips
--------------------------------
- Renamed page title and header from "Time Estimation Task" to "Administrative Procedure Study"
  to avoid priming participants about time estimation
- Removed condition label (Simple/Detailed) from the header — participants no longer see
  which experimental condition they are in
- Changed header icon from stopwatch (⏱) to clipboard (📋) to avoid time-related priming
- Added explicit instructions on both estimation pages (detailed and simple) explaining that
  participants can click on steps to reveal hidden sub-actions, with definitions of what
  "steps" and "sub-actions" are. Displayed as a styled tip box below the process map intro.

v8-spacing-decision-fix
-----------------------
- Fixed excessive empty space in phase 2 and 4 bands: rewrote adjustLayoutForZoneMinHeights()
  to distribute extra space evenly among gaps between steps within a zone (boundary-based
  proportional shifting), instead of concentrating all extra height below the last step
- Reduced zone padding (PAD_SVG 30 → 16) for tighter card-to-zone fit
- Decision diamond (step 2.3) now shows resolved outcome: green ✓ with label
  "Participants selected: 'Yes — eligible'" — clarifies that the procedure shown applies
  to participants who were found eligible

v7-two-page-estimation
----------------------
- Split both conditions into a two-page flow: instructions page → estimation page
- Page 1 (identical for both): consent → intro with all context (about the experiment,
  how it worked, overview, your task) → "Begin estimation" button
- Page 2 (condition-specific):
    Simple: full interactive SVG process map + contextual reminder + single overall estimate
    Detailed: side-by-side SVG map with zone brackets + 5 estimation cards (A–E)
- Added contextual reminder at top of estimation page so participants don't need to
  navigate back to re-read instructions
- Rationale: equalizes experience structure across conditions, ensures participants read
  instructions before estimating, avoids visual overload on a single page

v6-inline-dynamic-spacing
-------------------------
- Moved estimation inline onto the intro page (single-page layout for both conditions)
- Added dynamic SVG zone spacing: adjustLayoutForZoneMinHeights() post-processes the SVG
  layout so zones expand when estimation cards are taller than their natural zone height
- Two-pass rendering: first render measures cards, re-renders with zoneMinHeights if needed
- Estimation cards no longer overlap with steps from other zones

v5-sidebyside-positioned-cards
------------------------------
- Full BPMN-style SVG process map with side-by-side estimation layout (detailed condition)
- Zone brackets with colored vertical bars + letter circle badges (A–E) drawn on SVG
- Estimation cards absolutely positioned alongside their corresponding SVG zones
- Cards use SVG viewBox-to-pixel scale factor for precise vertical alignment
- Overlap prevention: cards shift downward if they would overlap the previous card
- Restored intro page for both conditions (was missing in earlier iteration)
- Fixed card sizing (too small in initial implementation)

v4-mini-svg-blocks
------------------
- Replaced text-based phase summaries with mini SVG process map blocks per estimation phase
- Each estimation block shows a compact visual of the steps it covers
- Steps are clickable to reveal hidden sub-actions inline

v3-likert-grouping-simple-inline
--------------------------------
- Switched confidence from dropdown to 5-point Likert scale with circular buttons
- Anchored scale: "Not at all confident" (1) to "Extremely confident" (5)
- Confidence made compulsory (validation blocks submission if missing)
- Grouped estimation blocks by phase with phase-colored headers
- Simple condition rendered inline (no separate page navigation)

v2-process-map-fixes
--------------------
- Fixed SVG process map rendering issues
- Corrected phase colors and step numbering
- Improved layout and spacing of process map elements
- Fixed interaction tracking for expanded steps

v1-redesign
-----------
- Initial design of the estimation task
- Two conditions: detailed (per-block estimation) and simple (overall estimate)
- Minutes + seconds dual input (no anchoring from suggested ranges)
- Interactive process map with expandable steps showing hidden sub-actions
- Server-side balanced randomization of conditions
- Prolific integration (PROLIFIC_PID, STUDY_ID, SESSION_ID)
- JSONL file-based data storage
- Consent → Intro → Estimation → Demographics → Completion flow
